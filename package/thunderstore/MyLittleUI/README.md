Bunch of little UI tweaks. Tooltips for production timers, player status, items. Custom chest names, buff list, multicraft, weather forecast and so on.

## Server sync
* Config values marked with [Synced with Server] tail in tooltip will be synchronized from the server to all clients.
* Most of that synced values are responsible for enabling/disabling whole section while the format of information is left to be chosen by client.
* Please use modpack shared configs or share your config manually if you want the rest of the config similar.

* Tracked weathers (Clear, Rain, Snow storm, Thunderstorm, Mist, Cinder Raid)
